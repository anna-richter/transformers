"I'm proud of this man. Thanks, thanks. Hey, congratulations.",0
"So my candy-ass, narrow-behind wife, came running when she heard some screaming from a motherfucker she doesn't know, who was being attacked by a black bear. You know Jack, a lot of people are afraid of me. Do you know why a lot of people are afraid of me?",-1
